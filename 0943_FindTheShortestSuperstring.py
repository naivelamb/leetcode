https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-shortest-superstring/

Since no word in words is substring of another word, when forming string of two words, we can only put one after the other. 
So we need to build a helper dp, where
dp[i][j] means the maximum length of shared parts of words[i] and words[j] if we form them in the order of
word[i], word[j]

Then we need to check all possibility of forming strings. 
here we need to use another dp array
dp[mask][k] means to form â€œmask" string by adding words[k] at the end, the shortest supersting. 

mask = 2 ^ n, max(k) = n

Time complexity: O(2^n * n^2)
