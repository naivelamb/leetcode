#1 Greedy
We know where to put the shortest guy, ans[k].
Then for the next shortest guy, we need to put him at the k-th empty slot.
Time complexity: O(nlogn + n^2)

#2 Insert order
We can start the procedure from the tallest people. Take
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
as an example, for people of height 7, we know that,
[[7, 0], [7, 1]] 
Then [6, 1] is inserted at location 1.
[[7, 0], [6, 1], [7, 1]]
And we keep this process going until all people is placed.
Time Complexity: O(nlogn + n^2)
